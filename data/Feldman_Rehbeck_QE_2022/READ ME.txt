Included in the replication folder are the following files:

Matlab Code Files:
	(1) DCmat.m - this file creates the DC.mat file which contains the averaged discrete choice data
	(2) FullAnalysisQE.m - this file contains the code that produces all statistics reported in the paper and Figure 6, Table 2, Figure 7, Table 3, Figure 10, Figure 11, 
				Table 4, Figure 17, Table 5, Table 6, Figure 18, Figure 19, and Table 7
	(3) AllBro.m - this file runs the bronars simulations to compute houtman maks
		Requirements: Gurobi optimization software, free to download for academics
	(4) RPTest.m - this file runs the houtman maks test for all subjects
		Requirements: Gurobi optimization software, free to download for academics
	(5) fEU.m - this function gives the distance of choices from expected utility predictions
	(6) latexTable.m - A function to help produce latex tables from matlab data
	(7) HMIG_FR.m - A function to generate the problem to compute the Houtman Maks Index from choice data

Matlab Datafiles:
	(1) RPwDC.mat - contains all task data including the discrete choices (Description of Columns in DCmat.m)
	(2) rpNumData.mat - contains task data only for the convex choice tasks (Description of Columns in FullAnalysis.m)
	(3) HMI8.mat - contains the Houtman-Maks results for a given run of the different benchmark behavior
	(4) TestResMain8.mat - contains the Houtman-Maks results for the subjects (This generates Table 4, formatting is custom) 
	(5) DC.mat - Matrix of the discrete choies as the "convex" version

R-files: 
	(1) Prefs4Mix_Comparisons.R - Recreates Figure 8
